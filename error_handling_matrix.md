# Error Handling Matrix

## Overview
This document defines a comprehensive matrix of error categories, their user-facing messages, and recovery suggestions to ensure consistent and helpful error handling across the application.

## Error Categories Matrix

### 1. API Quota Limits (HTTP 429)

**Error Category:** Rate Limiting / Quota Exceeded
**HTTP Status:** 429 Too Many Requests
**Priority:** High

#### Scenarios:
- Daily/monthly API quota exceeded
- Rate limit per minute/hour exceeded
- Concurrent request limit reached

#### User-Facing Messages:
- **Primary:** "You've reached your usage limit. Please try again later."
- **Detailed:** "You've exceeded the allowed number of requests. Your quota will reset at [TIME]."
- **With upgrade option:** "You've reached your current plan's limit. Upgrade for higher limits or try again in [DURATION]."

#### Recovery Suggestions:
1. **Immediate:** Wait for quota reset (display countdown timer if possible)
2. **Short-term:** Implement exponential backoff with jitter
3. **Long-term:** Consider upgrading plan or optimizing request frequency
4. **Technical:** Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls

#### Implementation Notes:
- Parse `Retry-After` header if available
- Store quota reset timestamps
- Implement client-side request queuing

### 2. Network Connectivity / Timeouts

**Error Category:** Network Infrastructure
**Priority:** High

#### Scenarios:
- Connection timeout (unable to establish connection)
- Read timeout (connection established but no response)
- DNS resolution failures
- SSL/TLS handshake failures
- Intermittent connectivity issues

#### User-Facing Messages:
- **Connection timeout:** "Unable to connect to the service. Please check your internet connection and try again."
- **Read timeout:** "The request is taking longer than expected. Please try again."
- **DNS failure:** "Unable to reach the service. Please check your network connection."
- **General network:** "Network error occurred. Please check your connection and retry."

#### Recovery Suggestions:
1. **Immediate:** Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
2. **User action:** Check internet connection
3. **Technical:** Switch to backup endpoints if available
4. **Fallback:** Use cached data if appropriate
5. **Advanced:** Implement circuit breaker pattern

#### Implementation Notes:
- Set reasonable timeout values (connect: 10s, read: 30s)
- Implement automatic retry with increasing delays
- Provide offline mode if applicable

---

### 3. Response Parsing Errors

**Error Category:** Data Processing
**Priority:** Medium-High

#### Scenarios:
- Invalid JSON/XML format
- Missing required fields in response
- Unexpected data types
- Encoding issues (UTF-8, etc.)
- Malformed API responses

#### User-Facing Messages:
- **JSON parsing:** "Received invalid data from the service. Please try again."
- **Missing fields:** "The service returned incomplete information. Please retry or contact support."
- **Type mismatch:** "Unexpected data format received. Please try again."
- **General parsing:** "Unable to process the server response. Please try again later."

#### Recovery Suggestions:
1. **Immediate:** Retry the request (may be temporary server issue)
2. **Fallback:** Use default values for optional fields
3. **Graceful degradation:** Display partial information if possible
4. **User action:** Refresh the page/app
5. **Escalation:** Log detailed error for debugging

#### Implementation Notes:
- Implement robust JSON parsing with try-catch blocks
- Validate response structure before processing
- Log parsing errors with request/response details
- Consider schema validation for critical responses

---

### 4. Invalid User Input

**Error Category:** Input Validation
**Priority:** Medium

#### Scenarios:
- Required fields missing
- Invalid data formats (email, phone, date)
- Data length constraints violated
- Invalid characters or patterns
- Business rule violations

#### User-Facing Messages:
- **Required field:** "This field is required. Please enter a valid [FIELD_TYPE]."
- **Format validation:** "Please enter a valid [FORMAT_TYPE] (e.g., email@example.com)."
- **Length constraints:** "This field must be between [MIN] and [MAX] characters."
- **Pattern mismatch:** "Please use only [ALLOWED_CHARACTERS] in this field."
- **Business rules:** "This [INPUT] conflicts with existing data. Please choose a different value."

#### Recovery Suggestions:
1. **Immediate:** Highlight specific field(s) with errors
2. **Guidance:** Provide format examples or hints
3. **Real-time:** Implement client-side validation for immediate feedback
4. **Helper text:** Show character counts, format requirements
5. **Auto-correction:** Suggest corrections when possible

#### Implementation Notes:
- Validate on both client and server side
- Provide specific, actionable error messages
- Use consistent validation rules across the application
- Consider progressive disclosure for complex validation rules

---

### 5. Uncaught Exceptions

**Error Category:** System Errors
**Priority:** Critical

#### Scenarios:
- Null pointer exceptions
- Memory allocation failures
- Database connection errors
- Third-party service failures
- Runtime errors and crashes

#### User-Facing Messages:
- **General:** "An unexpected error occurred. Our team has been notified. Please try again."
- **With error ID:** "Something went wrong (Error ID: [ERROR_ID]). Please try again or contact support with this ID."
- **Maintenance:** "The service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes."
- **Critical:** "We're experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later."

#### Recovery Suggestions:
1. **Immediate:** Automatic error reporting and logging
2. **User action:** Retry the operation
3. **Fallback:** Graceful degradation to basic functionality
4. **Support:** Provide error ID for support requests
5. **Prevention:** Implement comprehensive error boundaries

#### Implementation Notes:
- Implement global exception handlers
- Log all uncaught exceptions with context
- Generate unique error IDs for tracking
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement graceful error boundaries in UI components

## Error Handling Best Practices

### Message Principles:
1. **Clear and Simple:** Use plain language, avoid technical jargon
2. **Actionable:** Always provide next steps when possible
3. **Empathetic:** Acknowledge user frustration
4. **Consistent:** Use similar language patterns across error types

### Recovery Strategy Priorities:
1. **Automatic Recovery:** Handle errors transparently when possible
2. **User Guidance:** Provide clear instructions for user actions
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Maintain partial functionality
4. **Support Escalation:** Provide paths to get help

### Technical Implementation:
1. **Logging:** Comprehensive error logging with context
2. **Monitoring:** Real-time error tracking and alerting
3. **Testing:** Regular testing of error scenarios
4. **Documentation:** Keep error handling documentation updated

## Error Priority Matrix

| Error Category | User Impact | Frequency | Priority | Response Time |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Uncaught Exceptions | High | Low | Critical | Immediate |
| API Quota (429) | Medium | Medium | High | < 1 hour |
| Network/Timeouts | High | Medium | High | < 30 minutes |
| Response Parsing | Medium | Low | Medium-High | < 2 hours |
| Invalid Input | Low | High | Medium | Next release |

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track:
- Error rate by category
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- User retry success rates
- Support ticket volume by error type
- Error resolution time

### Alerting Thresholds:
- Uncaught exceptions: > 0.1% of requests
- Network errors: > 5% of requests
- API quota errors: > 10% of requests
- Parsing errors: > 1% of responses

This matrix should be reviewed and updated quarterly based on actual error patterns and user feedback.
